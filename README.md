# FirstTestApp
Sample Application with Unit Testing

In a Javascript environment, the Jasmine framework is typically used for writing tests and Karma is used to run them.
This is still the case for testing Ionic 2 applications, but Angular 2 has introduced the concept of the TestBed. Since Ionic 2 applications are built on top of Angular 2, we can also make use of TestBed in our Ionic 2 applications.

For testing use following command

npm test
